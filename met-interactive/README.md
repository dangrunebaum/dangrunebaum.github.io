# Interactive 

In Major Studio 1, students are assigned to create a series of visualizations based on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection database. 

## Ideation 

For the Interactive segment, I chose to expand on my qualitative data visualization based on the Met's "Play It Loud" exhibition, in which I viewed the show through the prism of the rivalry between Fender and Gibson, the two most famous makers of electric guitars. 

## Exhibition popups 

 As the "Play It Loud" objects weren't in the museum database, I built my own database of the 47 Fenders and Gibsons shown in the exhibition. I utilized Excel, p5.js, HTML, CSS, Jquery and Illustrator to create a visualization that allows viewers to compare the usage of Fenders and Gibsons by rockstars according to time, and to view the guitars, read exhibition texts and listen to song samples via an interactive popup.
