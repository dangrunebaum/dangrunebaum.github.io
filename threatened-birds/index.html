        <div id="explainer">The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List Index for the world's birds shows that there has been a steady deterioration in the threat status of the world's birds since 1988, when the first complete global assessment was carried out. 1,486 or some 14% of all species are listed as threatened in 2018. Globally, threatened birds occur worldwide - nearly all countries support one or more threatened bird species. Small islands hold disproportionately high numbers of Globally Threatened Birds, supporting over half of threatened species. Threatened seabirds are found throughout the world's oceans. The most important threats to the world's birds are the spread of agriculture and an ever increasing human use of biological resources.

           <br><br>Threatened species are the number of species classified by the IUCN as endangered, vulnerable, rare, indeterminate, out of danger, or insufficiently known. Source: World Bank.
