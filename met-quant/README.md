# The Met: A Culture Timeline 
## This data visualization seeks to answer the question: Can the cultures of the Met serve as a lens for human history?

## Abstract
The vast size of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection presented the opportunity to utilize it as a proxy for understanding the interaction of civilizations over time. I was interested to learn if the almost 500,000 objects theirein contained a hidden story that could be uncovered with visualization techniques. 

## Quantitative Summation 
Utilizing the cultures column in the Met's collection database, I first constructed a bar graph summarizing the top ten cultures present in the museum. ![Bar Chart](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/met-quant/1.%20cultures-bar-chart.png)

## Timeline 
The next step was building the cultures timeline in the form of a stacked bar chart. 70 millenia of history are represented by the timeline, with columns broken down by century. The color-coded bar chart above serves as a visual key for understanding the representation by percent in the Met's collection of the top ten cultures over time. ![Timeline](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/met-quant/2.%20cultures-wide.png)
