# The Met: A Culture Timeline 
## This data visualization seeks to answer the question: Can the cultures of the Met serve as a lens for human history?

## Abstract
The vast size of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection presented the opportunity to utilize it as a proxy for understanding the interaction of civilizations over time. I was interested to learn if the almost 500,000 objects theirein contained a hidden story that could be uncovered with visualization techniques. 

## Quantitative Summation 
Utilizing the cultures column in the Met's collection database, I first constructed a bar graph summarizing the top ten cultures present in the museum. ![Bar Chart](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/met-quant/1.%20cultures-bar-chart.png)

## Timeline 
The next step was building the cultures timeline in the form of a stacked bar chart. 70 millenia of history are represented by the timeline, with columns broken down by century. The color-coded bar chart above serves as a visual key for understanding the representation by percent in the Met's collection of the top ten cultures over time. ![Timeline](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/met-quant/2.%20cultures-wide.png)

## Detailed Information 
A tooltip provides specific information on the number of objects by century, allowing users to better grasp the trajectory of the Met collection's growth over time. ![Tooltip](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/met-quant/3.%20cultures-tooltip.png)

## Conclusion 
While visualizing the top ten cultures at the Met was a useful investigation, the process revealed less conclusive information about the interaction of civilizations over time than it did about the nature of the Met's collection itself. The collection was created through the accrual of major purchases and gifts over time. Visualizing the collection by culture thus likely says less about civilization than it does about the idiosyncracies of the acquisition process.
