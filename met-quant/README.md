# The Met: A Cultures Timeline 
## This data visualization seeks to answer the question: Can the cultures of the Met serve as a lens for human history?

## Ideation
The vast size of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection presented the opportunity to utilize it as a proxy for understanding the interaction of civilizations over time. I was interested to learn if the almost 500,000 objects theirein contained a hidden story that could be uncovered with visualization techniques. 

## Quantitative Summation 
Utilizing the cultures column in the Met's collection database, I first constructed a bar graph summarizing the top ten cultures present in the museum.
