# Culture Timeline Documentation

## 1. Ideation 
This project began with the belief that vast size of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection presented the opportunity to understand the interaction of civilizations over time. I was inspired by timelines including this Google Research Music Timeline. <br/>

<br/>
In the Met collection database, the culture column offered the most obvious proxy for human civilizations. I envisioned a stacked area chart as the best candidate for visualizing cultures over time in a cognitively simple graphic. <br/>

## 2. Prepare CSV table 
Due to the large size of the collection CSV, I reduced the table to the few columns required for the visualization.

## 4. Implement Filter
Code filter of guitar makes and models with JavaScript and Jquery.

## 5. Ideation for Sound and Waveform Comparison 
Inspired by online debate and kitchen science such as [this article]() I outlined an interactive using the p5.js FFT analyzer. ![Sound sketch]() 

## 6. Code Sound and Waveform 
Build visualization with p5.js FFT from p5 sound library, code interactions with JavaScript.

## 7. Ideation for Mobile Version 
Given the size of the graph and waveform canvases, recreating the site for mobile screens required re-envisioning it in multi-page form with Illustrator.

## 8. Code Mobile Site
Wrote separate JavaScript, CSS and HTML scripts for mobile site as well as new index.html for redirect to desktop or mobile.
