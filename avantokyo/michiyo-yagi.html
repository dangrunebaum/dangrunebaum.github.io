        <p>
            Thursday, February 9th at 8pm ET, AvanTokyo and ISSUE Project Room are pleased to present a new
            collaboration between Japanese improviser, composer, and koto player Michiyo Yagi and Norwegian musician,
            record producer and professor Jan Bang. The duo’s new work streams on AvanTokyo and ISSUE’s sites.

            Notes from Michiyo Yagi regarding “Through a Looking Glass,” her collaboration with Jan Bang
        </p>
        <p>
            “Like many musicians the world over, I have been forced to work in a confined space during the past two
            years, whether performing for a virtual audience I am unable to see/feel or teaching masked students whose
            expressions are no longer readable. Although my music incorporates some electronics, it is essentially about
            a primitive acoustic instrument with a tiny sound trying to be heard around the world, and the Pandemic has
            been a stifling wall. Who, then, could be a better partner for this project than Jan Bang, whose
            multifarious career has largely been about breaking down walls? With these thoughts in mind, I sent Jan a
            set of improvisations and short compositions, imagining he would filter them in various ways — adding to or
            subtracting from the raw material, distorting/clarifying the components through his kaleidoscopic
            imagination, and ultimately unifying them in that unique sonic environment for which he is renowned.” —
            Michiyo Yagi

            Michiyo Yagi studied the traditional Japanese transverse harp known as the koto under the late Tadao Sawai
            and Kazue Sawai, and graduated from the NHK Professional Training School for Traditional Musicians. During
            her subsequent tenure as Visiting Professor of Music at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, U.S.A. she
            premiered numerous modern compositions for koto and came under the influence of maverick American composers
            such as John Cage, Christian Wolff, Conlon Nancarrow, and John Zorn. Yagi’s debut CD Shizuku was produced by
            Zorn and released on his Tzadik label in 1999. In 2001 she recorded Yural (BAJ/ewe) with her multi-koto
            ensemble Paulownia Crush—this group toured Russia under the auspices of the Japan Foundation in 2004. In
            2005, Yagi released Seventeen (Zipangu), entirely performed on the giant 17-string bass koto. Live! at
            SuperDeluxe (Idiolect), a trio performance with Norwegian Ingebrigt Håker Flaten (contrabass) and Paal
            Nilssen-Love (drums), followed a year later.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        In 2008, Rikskonsertene, the national concert institute of Norway, sponsored a two-week tour by Yagi,
        Nilssen-Love, and German saxophonist Peter Brötzmann, a trio that has performed internationally since 2006 and
        released Head On (Idiolect, 2008) and Volda (Idiolect, 2010). Reflexions (Idiolect/Bomba), duets with the
        experimental New York guitarist Elliott Sharp, was released in 2010. Soul Stream, a quartet session with Joe
        McPhee (pocket trumpet, saxophones), Lasse Marhaug (electronics) and Nilssen-Love; and Angular Mass, a trio with
        Marhaug and Nilssen-Love, were both released in 2015 on PNL Records. Dōjō, Yagi’s “power duo” with drummer
        Tamaya Honda, has released Ichi No Maki [Vol. 1] (Idiolect, 2014), featuring guests Nils Peter Molvær (trumpet)
        and Paal Nilssen-Love, and Ni No Maki [Vol. 2] (Idiolect, 2017) with guests Akira Sakata (reeds & voice) and
        Keisuke Ohta (violin). Yagi’s latest album as a leader is Into The Forest (2019) a CD of original compositions
        (several featuring Yagi’s vocals). Most recently, Live At SuperDeluxe, a collaboration with the Anglo-Norwegian
        trio The Geordie Approach, was released as an LP by Discus Music in late 2021.

            Upcoming are an album of ambient music co-produced by the Norwegian guitarist Eivind Aarset, a duo session
            with composer/musician Dai Fujikura, a trio recording with Giovanni Di Domenico (keyboards) and Chris
            Corsano (drums), another trio work with Corsano and Mette Rasmussen (alto saxophone), and two more Dōjō
            collaborations, one featuring saxophonist Jon Irabagon and another with guitarist/oud player Gordon Grdina.
            An eclectic performer who continually challenges conventions, Yagi has played at the Born Creative, Moers,
            Kongsberg Jazz, Punkt, Újbuda Jazz, Musique Actuel Victoriaville, Archipel, Bang on a Can, Tokyo Summer,
            Vision, Instal, Jazztopad, Sengawa Jazz, Fuji Rock, Music Unlimited, and Météo-Mulhouse festivals. Notable
            co-performers include Mark Dresser, Jim O’Rourke, Akira Sakata, Sidsel Endresen, Han Bennink, Alan Silva,
            Kazutoki Umezu, Raz Mesinai, Yoshihide Otomo, Ned Rothenberg, Knut Buen, Bugge Wesseltoft, Satoko Fujii,
            Håkon Kornstad, Tatsuya Yoshida (Ruins), Masahiko Satō, Thomas Strønen, Carl Stone, Billy Bang, Keiji Haino,
            Mats Gustafsson, Roger Turner, Gerry Hemingway, Mani Neumeier (Guru Guru), and Sachiko M.

            Yagi’s koto has been featured in ex-Judy & Mary guitarist/singer Takuya’s band, and she has recorded with
            neo-prog rocker Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree), J-pop idol Ayumi Hamasaki, singer-songwriter Angela Aki,
            singer/actress Kō Shibasaki, and the psychedelic pop band Tempalay. In addition to performing solo, with the
            Michiyo Yagi Trio or the newly-formed multi-koto ensemble Talon – all with an emphasis on her original
            compositions, extended techniques, and unique vocals based on the traditional jiuta style – Yagi continues
            to be active as the leading improviser on her instrument.

            overlapping concerts one being the original, the other the remix. The Punkt brand has gained a reputation
            among musicians as being artist friendly and always putting the musicians needs first. Punkt already

            During the Winter, 2022, AvanTokyo and ISSUE are continuing to commission artists as part of the Distant
            Pairs series, producing collaborative work at a time when the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has drastically
            impacted their ability to travel and perform, and altered the nature of collective work and performance.
            Pairing artists in disparate locations who cannot work together in “traditional” ways, the Distant Pairs
            series examines the collaborative process, methods of working, and partnership amidst these constrained
            conditions.
