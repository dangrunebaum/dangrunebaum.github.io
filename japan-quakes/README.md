## EARTHQUAKES AND JAPAN 

### Introduction
Japan accounts for about 20 percent of worldwide earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. Much of its population is densely concentrated in its most seismically active areas. This map aims to 1) Place Japanese Seismic activity in a global context, 2) Focus on Japan's deadliest earthquakes since precise measurements began in the 20th c., and 3) Allow viewers to zoom in on the nation to highlight the proximity of Japan's largest population centers to earthquake activity. 

### Map
A world map of all earthquakes over M4.5 over the last month, with magnitude encoded by color value. Location of event and magnitude indicated in rollovers.

### Diagram	
The diagram consists of three elements: 1) A comparison of this week's largest global Seismic event and Japan's largest recorded earthquake, the m9.0 2011 Tohoku quake, both represented with circles encoded by magnitude, 2) A bar chart showing Japan's deadliest earthquake, the 1923 Kanto quake, in context with the deadliest earthquakes worldwide 1900-2016 (source: Statista), and 3) A minimal key indicating orange for Japan Seismic events and green for global events.
