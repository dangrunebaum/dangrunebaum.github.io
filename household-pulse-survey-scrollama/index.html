                        Not only were people of color and mixed race paying a steeper cost in deaths and economic impact, their mental health was also suffering unequally.

            <h1>Anxiety, Depression Climbed Amid Pandemic</h1>
            <br>
<p>
Anxiety and depression leapt among Americans as the COVID-19 pandemic raged last fall and winter.
<br>
<br>
A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the percentage of American adults with recent symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder jumped from 36.4% in August 2020 to 42.4% in February 2021. 
<br>
<br>
The report summarizes the CDC and Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, launched to rapidly monitor mental health status and access to care during the pandemic.
</p>
<br>
<h1>Hispanics, Blacks Suffered Disproportionately</h1>
<br>
<p>
Significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed for all racial and ethnic groups except for non-Hispanic adults reporting races other than Black, White or Asian.
<br>
<br>
Hispanic or Latino Americans saw the greatest jump of 8.2 percentage points. 
<br>
<br>
Blacks suffered the next worse increase of 7.2 percentage points in numbers reporting increased symptoms of anxiety or depression between August and February. 
<br>
<br>
Asians saw a jump of 5 percentage points and whites experienced a rise of 2.7 percentage points. 
<br>
<br>
Women, with a 4.4 percentage point rise, and men with a 4.3 percentage point rise seem to have been affected similarly over the time frame. 
</p>
<br>
<h1>The Young Hit Hardest</h1>
<br>
<p>
Anxiety and depression rose significantly for all age groups except adults aged 80 and over. 
<br>
<br>
The largest increases hit the young. The number of 18-29 year-olds reporting symptoms of anxiety or depression rose 8 percentage points from August 2020 to February 2021. 
<br>
<br>
All demographic groups showed rises in anxiety and depression as COVID-19 cases jumped in the summer and fall. 
<br>
<br>
The report’s authors note that, “The spread of disease and increase in deaths during large outbreaks of transmissible diseases is often associated with fear and grief.” 
<br>
<br>
They say social restrictions and business closings can further increase the risk for mental health problems. 
<br>
<br>
Between January 20 and February 1 this year, more than two in five adults aged 18 and over reported experiencing symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder in the past seven days. 
<br>
<br>
Respondents with less than a high school education were also among the most affected, suffering a 7.8 percentage point increase in symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder in the past week.
<br>
<br>
By contrast, only a 2.2 percentage point rise was observed among Americans with a Bachelor’s degree or higher. 
<br>
<br>
The Household Pulse survey began in April after the pandemic was already underway. 
<br>
<br>
But the authors cite for context the roughly 11% rate for an anxiety and/or depressive disorder among respondents to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey.
</p>
<br>
<h1>Unmet Mental Health Needs</h1>
<br>
<p>
The number of Americans receiving prescription medications and mental health counseling saw a significant jump as COVID-19 cases rose from fall into winter–but the increase in unmet mental health needs was even higher. 
<br>
<br>
From August to February, the percentage of Americans receiving mental health care treatment increased from 22.4% to 24.8% for a 2.4 percentage point increase. 
<br>
<br>
But in the same period, the number of Americans with symptoms of an anxiety or a depressive disorder and unmet mental health needs rose 2.8 percentage points from 21% to 23.8%. 
<br>
<br>
Young adults and those with less than a high school education were again the worst affected. 
<br>
<br>
The number of adults aged 18-29 saw an increase of 7.2 percentage points in unmet mental health needs, while those with less than a high school education experienced a 4.3 point rise.
