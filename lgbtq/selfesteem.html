    Social psychologist Dr. Corina Lelutiu-Weinberger and her colleagues generate evidence-based guidelines for clinical practice and policy, in order to contribute to reducing chronic conditions of high prevalence among minority groups due to discrimination and inadequate resources. <p>This new study focuses on discrimination and internalized homophobia as predictors for HIV prevention-related outcomes among men who have sex with men, as measured by regular, 6-month HIV testing and awareness of biomedical prevention, or Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP).</p> <p>Men who have sex with men are among the highest HIV risk groups in the US. Findings from Dr. Lelutiu-Weinbergerâ€™s research will inform intervention approaches that are effective in reducing HIV-related risk among this vulnerable group.</p> <p>The histograms at left show a correlation between low self-esteem and risk reduction in the form of regular HIV testing and PrEP awareness. Conversely, study participants with higher self-esteem were less likely to be tested regularly or be aware of PrEP.</p><p><p>The scatterplot beneath plots self-esteem by dot size and opacity in relation to internalized homophobia and perceived discrimination.</p>The four scatterplots at the bottom show the relationship between self-esteem, perceived discrimination and HIV testing or PrEP awareness.</p>
