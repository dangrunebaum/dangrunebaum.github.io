## Discrimination and Internalized Homophobia as Predictors for Regular HIV Testing and PREP Awareness

I worked with Rutgers University Professor Corina Lelutiu-Weinberger to visualize her 2018 study of self-esteem as a predictor of HIV testing and PrEP HIV prevention treatment awareness among men who have sex with men.  Histograms and scatterplots make clearly visible the results of the study, which showed that participants with low self-esteem were more likely to be regularly tested and aware of PrEP.

Dr. Corina Lelutiu-Weinberger and her colleagues generate evidence-based guidelines for clinical practice and policy, in order to contribute to reducing chronic conditions of high prevalence among minority groups due to discrimination and inadequate resources. Findings from Dr. Lelutiu-Weinbergerâ€™s research informed intervention approaches that are effective in reducing HIV-related risk among this vulnerable group.
