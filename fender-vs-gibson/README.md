# Fender vs Gibson: The Great Guitar Debate 

Inspired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's "Play It Loud" exhibition, this data visualization explores the Fender-Gibson rivalry. 

## Quantitative and Qualitative Data 

The two legendary guitar makers Fender and Gibson defined the sound of rock, designing cutting-edge instruments that powered the innovations of guitarists from Chuck Berry through to Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello. Through this visualization, I explore the interplay between Fender and Gibson’s brand identities and the rockstars of “Play It Loud.” The visualization looks at the 47 Fenders and Gibsons present in “Play It Loud,” placed on a graph according to year of manufacture and rockstar, with accompanying data on landmark songs from “Johnny B. Goode” to number one hits like “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll.” 

## Interactivity 

Popups offer detailed exhibition texts and images of each guitar retrieved dynamically from the “Play It Loud” website, alongside a Spotify iFrame that allows users to listen to a song sample featuring each guitar. With a filter, users can also dig down into which brands and guitar models were used when, and by which rockstar.![Popup](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/fender-vs-gibson/1.%20desktop-graph.png)

## Sound and Wave Form Comparison 

Central to the Fender/Gibson rivalry is the debate over tone, with some preferring Fender's brightness and others Gibson's warmth. Inspired by numerous online forums devoted to this debate, I sampled a Fender Stratocaster and Gibson Les Paul, and used p5.js's FFT sound analyzer to build an interactive that allows users to compare sound and wave forms and come to their own conclusions. ![Sound](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/fender-vs-gibson/2.%20desktop-sound.png)

## Mobile 

I recreated the full functionality and affordances of the desktop site in mobile form, optimized for the iPhone X. Users are invited to experience the Fender vs Gibson data visualization as an accompaniment to viewing the “Play It Loud” exhibition as it travels the nation. ![Mobile](https://github.com/dangrunebaum/dangrunebaum.github.io/blob/master/fender-vs-gibson/3.%20mobile-graph.jpg)
