## NYC Culture Map 

### Introduction
What is the cultural geography of New York City? And what, for example, is the distribution of music, museums or movie organizations? Are there more dance organizations in Brooklyn or the Bronx...? This visualization maps over 2,000 citywide organizations in the Department of Cultural Affairs directory. Users can interact with the map to understand how 18 color-coded disciplines are distributed across New York, and which discipline boasts the most organizations. Built with JavaScript, Leaflet and p5.js.
